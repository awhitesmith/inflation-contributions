# Inflation contributions

A tool for calculating group / subgroup / expenditure class percentage point contributons to CPI in Australia and the capital cities.

More info on the method can be found at https://awhitesmith.com/posts/inflation-contributions/

**Note**: the contributions will not exactly sum to the total year-ended and year-average change as the ABS round their index numbers and weights.
